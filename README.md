# realtime-chatapp
A real time chat app created using nodejs, expressjs and socket.io

## access 
Just head over to the link in the project header :) 

## time spent 
30 minutes with limited internet at the airport 

## i dont like <insert thing you didn't like>
I appreciate all and any kinda feedback; email me over at abhinav.goyal@live.com / abhinav8@hku.hk

## updates 
In the future I am looking to add a database to produce persistent data. As of now, I haven't integrated a database so the chat logs disappear as soon as the user leaves the page
